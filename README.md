# [Build a Mini Netflix Clone with Vue](https://cloudinary.gitbooks.io/build-a-mini-netflix-clone-with-vue/content/)

In this lab, we will build out a **Mini Netflix** with Vue and Cloudinary in 10 minutes (possible less). Check out the live [Demo](https://stupefied-mirzakhani-71dd38.netlify.com/).

Developers are challenged daily with building complex products and struggle with time constraints for delivering the features of these products.

Engineering and Product managers want to beat deadlines for projects daily. CEOs want to roll out new products as fast as possible. Entrepreneurs need their MVPs like yesterday. With this in mind, what should developers do?

If you want to check out the final project, visit the Github repo:

* [Client Code](https://github.com/cloudinary-developers/vue-mini-netflix-demo-client)

* [Server Code](https://github.com/cloudinary-developers/vue-mini-netflix-demo-server)

## What You Need

This guide assumes you:

* Have a working knowledge of [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and JavaScript.
* Understand the basics of serverless computing (we'll be using [Webtask](https://webtask.io/))
* Have experience with NodeJS (used to program Webtasks, install [Node](https://nodejs.org/))

Here is a list of all the high level tools we will use:

- Vue
- Webtask
- Node.js
- Cloudinary
- Mongo DB
- Command Line
- Bulma CSS

## What We Will Build

Just like I mentioned in the beginning, we will build a Mini Netflix app with some of the features you see on Netflix website:

- Listing movies
- Selecting a movie
- Watching a movie trailer
- Sharing trailers on Twitter
- Bonus: Uploading new movie trailers

## How We Will Build

The architecture of this project favours decentralizing to singleton. We have 3 major sections:

- Frontend (Vue)
- Backend (Webtask FaaS)
- Database (Mongo)

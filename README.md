# [Build a Mini Netflix Clone with Vue](https://cloudinary.gitbooks.io/build-a-mini-netflix-clone-with-vue/content/)

In this lab, we will build out a **Mini Netflix** with Vue and Cloudinary in 10 minutes. In fact, I think we might build it less time. Check out the demo.

Developers are constantly faced with challenges of building complex products every single day. And there are constraints on the time needed to build out the features of these products.

Engineering and Product managers want to beat deadlines for projects daily. CEOs want to roll out new products as fast as possible. Entrepreneurs need their MVPs like yesterday. With this in mind, what should developers do?

If you want to check out the final project, visit the Github repo:

* [Client Code](https://github.com/cloudinary-developers/vue-mini-netflix-demo)

* [Server Code](https://github.com/cloudinary-developers/vue-mini-netflix-demo-server)

You can also see the demo live here:

## What You Need

This guide assumes you:

* Worked with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) recently and have a fair knowledge of JavaScript.
* Understand the basics what SaaS and FaaS is.
* Know what Node.js is and some basic knowledge. Node will be used for the Serverless Webtask. You can install Node from the [Node website](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Here is a list of all the high level tools we will use:

- Vue
- Webtask
- Node.js
- Cloudinary
- Mongo DB
- Command Line
- Bulma CSS

## What We Will Build

Just like I mentioned in the beginning, we will build a Mini Netflix app with some of the features you see on Netflix website:

- Listing movies
- Selecting a movie
- Watching a movie trailer
- Sharing trailers on Twitter
- Bonus: Uploading new movie trailers

## How We Will Build

The architecture of this project favours decentralizing to singleton. We have 3 major sections:

- Frontend (Vue)
- Backend (Webtask FaaS)
- Database (Mongo)

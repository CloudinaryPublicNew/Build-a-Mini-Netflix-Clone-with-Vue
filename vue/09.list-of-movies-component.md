# Create a List of Movies

Recall that you need a component that lists all the available movies, that is, those that are in the database. From this list, Your users can then pick from that list the movie they would like to watch.

Add a `VideoList` component with the following content:

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <div class="columns" v-for="i in Math.ceil(movies.length / 6)" :key="i">
      <div v-if="movies.length < 1">Loading...</div>
      <div v-else v-for="movie in movies.slice((i - 1) * 6, i * 6)" :key="movie._id" class="column">
        <img :src="cloudinaryInstance.url(movie.banner)" alt="" class="banner" @click="$emit('choose-movie', movie)">
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
<script>
import axios from 'axios';
export default {
  props: ['cloudinaryInstance', 'movies'],
}
</script>
<style>
.banner {
  max-width: 204px;
  height: auto;
}
.banner:hover {
  cursor: pointer;
}
</style>
```

The props that are passed are `cloudinaryInstance` and `movies`. The instance that resolves an image URL from its public ID while the `movies` array will be iterated and used to show a list of movies in a 6-column grid.

Take a closer look at the image tag:

```html
<img :src="cloudinaryInstance.url(movie.banner)" alt="" class="banner" @click="$emit('choose-movie', movie)">
```

We attached a click event on each image. When an image is clicked, we emit an event called `chhose-movie` to the parent component with a payload of the selected movie.

# Show a List of Movies

To populate the `list` component with a list of movies from `App` the parent component, make a request to your server for the data.


## Fetch the Movies
To obtain a list of the movies:

1. Import `axios`, a library for making Ajax requests:

  ```js
  import axios from 'axios';
  ```

2. Add the Ajax logic to the `created` lifecycle method of the `App` component:

  ```js
  axios.get(this.url)
  .then(res => {
  this.movies = res.data;
  })
  ```

  The logic makes a `get` request with `axios` to a URL stored in `this.url`. When a payload returns, it sets `this.movies` to the value of the payload.

3. Define `movies` and `url` in the model:

```js
data() {
  return {
    movie: {},
    movies: [],
    url: '<YOUR WEBTASK URL>/movies'
  };
},
```

## Render `VideoList`

Now import the `VideoList` component and render its element.

1. Import `VideoList`:

  ```js
  import VideoList from './components/VideoList.vue';
  ```

2. Specify the child in the component:

  ```js
  components: {
  VideoPlayer,
  VideoList
}
```

3. Render to the DOM immediately below the `VideoPlayer` component:

  ```html
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="is-size-3">Movies</h2>
 movie="updatePlayer" :movies="movies"></VideoList>
  </div>
```

## Handle the Selected Videos

Afterwards, the `choose-movie` event calls the `updatePlayer` method when the event is triggered. Therefore, add `updatePlayer` to the `methods` object:

```js
methods: {
  updatePlayer(movie) {
    this.movie = movie;
  },
}
```

`updatePlayer` sets the value of `movie`, which triggers the watch in `VideoPlayer`, hence a change in the trailer that is playing.

So far, so good:

# Show a List of Movies

To populate the `list` component with a list of movies from `App` the parent component, make a request to your server for the data.


## Fetch the Movies

1. Import `axios`, a library for making Ajax requests:

```js
import axios from 'axios';
```

2. Add the Ajax logic to the `created` lifecycle method of the `App` component:

```js
axios.get(this.url)
.then(res => {
  this.movies = res.data;
})
```

  The logic makes a `get` request with `axios` to a URL stored in `this.url`. When a payload gets back, it sets `this.movies` to the value of the payload.

You also need to define `movies` and `url` in the model:

```js
data() {
  return {
    movie: {},
    movies: [],
    url: '<YOUR WEBTASK URL>/movies'
  };
},
```

## Render The `VideoList`

You need to import the `VideoList` component and render itâ€™s element.

Start with importing it:

```js
import VideoList from './components/VideoList.vue';
```

Next, tell the component about the child:

```js
components: {
  VideoPlayer,
  VideoList
}
```

Then render to the DOM right after the `VideoPlayer` component:

```html
<div class="container">
  <h2 class="is-size-3">Movies</h2>
  <VideoList :cloudinaryInstance="cloudinaryInstance" @choose-movie="updatePlayer" :movies="movies"></VideoList>
</div>
```

## Handling Selected Videos

The `choose-movie` event is going to call an `updatePlayer` method anytime the event is triggered. Add the method to the methods object:

```js
methods: {
  updatePlayer(movie) {
    this.movie = movie;
  },
}
```

It simply sets the value of `movie` which triggers the watch in the `VideoPlayer`. Hence, a change in the currently playing trailer.

So far, so good:

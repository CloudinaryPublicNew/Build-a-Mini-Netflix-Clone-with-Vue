# Setting Up a Vue Client

We are done with the server and itâ€™s time to get back to building out the client. The client app will leave in a different folder and will be written in Vue. Vue simplifies things like DOM manipulation and state management.


## Install the Vue CLI

With the Vue CLI (just like the Webtask CLI), you can scaffold a new Vue project without the configuration hassle:

```bash
npm install @vue/cli -g
```

## Create a New Vue Project

You could use the CLI tool you just installed to create a Vue project:

```bash
vue create mini-netflix
```

Move into the folder that is created by the command:

```bash
cd mini-netflix
```

Test run the scaffold:

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Dependencies

We need some libraries to get going through the project. Update your `package.json` file:

```js
"dependencies": {
  "axios": "^0.18.0",
  "node-sass": "^4.7.2",
  "sass-loader": "^6.0.7",
  "sweet-modal-vue": "^2.0.0",
  "vue": "^2.5.13"
},
```

Run `npm install` to download those.

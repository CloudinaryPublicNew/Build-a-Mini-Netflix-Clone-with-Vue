# Crate Movies

As a final task, take the modal in the preceding section live.


## Upload Modal Trigger

Update the Nav bar to include a button we can click to launch the upload modal:

```html
<div class="navbar-menu">
  <div class="navbar-end">
    <a class="button navbar-item" @click="showModal = !showModal">
      Upload
    </a>
  </div>
</div>
```

It flips a `showModal` boolean every time we click it. Add the property to the data model:

```js
showModal: false,
```

Add the `UploadModal` to the App component as a child. Start with adding the element right after the container div:

```html
<UploadModal :showModal="showModal" @handle-upload="uploadToServer"></UploadModal>
```

Notice we are passing the `showModal` down to the component. We will get to what `handle-upload` event is about soon.

Import the `UploadModal` to App as usual:

```js
import UploadModal from './components/UploadModal.vue';

export default {
  //...
  components: {
    //...
    UploadModal
  }
}
```

## Watching `showModal`

We need to show the modal by watching the value of `showModal` prop in the `UploadModal` component:

```js
watch: {
  showModal(val) {
    val ? this.$refs.modal.open() : this.$refs.modal.close();
  }
},
```

You can click the upload button to reveal the modal:

## Handling Image and Video Upload

Wheen each of the upload buttons on the modal is clicked, the `startUpload` is called but with different arguments. We need to create this method:

```js
methods: {
  startUpload(type) {
    cloudinary.openUploadWidget(
      { cloud_name: 'christekh', upload_preset: 'idcidr0h' },
      (error, result) => {
        console.log(error, result[0]);
        type === 'banner'
          ? (this.banner = result[0].public_id)
          : (this.trailer = result[0].public_id);
      }
    );
  },
},
```

The method launches the upload widget which gives us the freedom to upload images or videos. After the upload we set the value either the banner or trailer model depending on which button was clicked.

Apart from the `cloud_name`, we also need an unsigned `upload_preset` before we can make uploads. Head to the [upload settings on Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/console/settings/upload) to create one.

The upload widget uses a different library for modularity. Add this below the scripts in `public/index.html`:

```html
<script src="//widget.cloudinary.com/global/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script>  
```

Click the upload button on the modal and you should see the widget appear:

## Emitting an Upload Event

The form has a `handleUpload` event attached to it. When the submit button is clicked, we must have set the title and the Ids for the media contents. This method checks if those values are available before emitting an event to the parent component to perform the upload.

Add this to the methods object:

```js
handleUpload() {
  const data = {
    title: this.title,
    banner: this.banner,
    trailer: this.trailer
  };
  if (data.title && this.banner && this.trailer)
    this.$emit('handle-upload', data);
}
```

## Uploading to the Server

Recall the element for `UploadModal` looks like this:

```html
<UploadModal :showModal="showModal" @handle-upload="uploadToServer"></UploadModal>
```

The `uploadToServer` method is the hander for the event emitted in the child component. Create the method in the methods object:

```js
uploadToServer(data) {
  axios.post(this.url, data).then(res => {
    this.movies = [...this.movies, res.data];
    this.showModal = false;
  })
}
```

The method pushes to the server and updates the list with the new entry. It also hides the modal.

This is how the App component script looks like:

```js
import axios from 'axios';
import VideoPlayer from './components/VideoPlayer.vue';
import VideoList from './components/VideoList.vue';
import UploadModal from './components/UploadModal.vue';

export default {
  data() {
    return {
      movie: {},
      movies: [],
      showModal: false,
      url: 'https://wt-nwambachristian-gmail_com-0.run.webtask.io/server/movies'
    }
  },
  created() {
    this.cloudinaryInstance = window.cloudinary.Cloudinary.new({
      cloud_name: 'christekh',
      secure: true
    });
    axios.get(this.url)
      .then(res => {
        this.movies = res.data;
      })
  },
  methods: {
    updatePlayer(movie) {
      this.movie = movie;
    },
    uploadToServer(data) {
      axios.post(this.url, data).then(res => {
        this.movies = [...this.movies, res.data];
        this.showModal = false;
      })
    }
  },
  components: {
    VideoPlayer,
    VideoList,
    UploadModal
  }
};
```

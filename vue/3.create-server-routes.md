# Create Server Routes

So far we just have a index route that says “Hello World”. We need more than that. We need a routes that allows us to retrieve all movies from the database as well as another to save a movie.

Before creating the routes, you need to setup the middleware before all routes:

```js
app.use(require('./middleware/db').connectDisconnect);
```

## Secrets, Bundling and Watching

Last time we ran the app, we simply used the `create` command on the `index.js` file. This time we need to:


1. Bundle two files (index and db)
2. Provide secrets (env) and
3. Watch for changes.

You can run with the following to achieve all:

```bash
wt create index --secret MONGO_URL=<MONGOLAB-CONNECTION-URL> --bundle --watch
```

You can get the URL from the database home:

## Create A Movie Route

Add the following route right after the `/` route:

```js
app.post('/movies', (req, res) => {
  const newMovie = new req.movieModal(
    Object.assign(req.body, { created_at: Date.now() })
  );
  newMovie.save((err, savedMovie) => {
    res.json(savedMovie);
  });
});
```

Two things is going on here:

1. We create a new movie using the movie modal.
2. Then we save the movie and return the saved movie to the client.

You can test with Postman:

## Retrieve All Movies

Add the following route to retrieve all existing movies:

```js
app.get('/movies', (req, res) => {
  req.movieModal
    .find({})
    .sort({ created_at: -1 })
    .exec((err, movies) => res.json(movies));
});
```

The route finds all exising movies, sort them by date in reverse order, and returns the moves:

# Set Up and Initialize a Cloudinary Account 

Create the `cloudinaryInstance` instance so you can pass it to `VideoPlayer`, letâ€™s create the instance right away.


## Cloudinary Account

Create a [Cloudinary account or log in](https://cloudinary.com/users/login) to your dashboard:

You should get a dashboard that looks like the one below:

Your credentials are the content of **Cloud name**, **API Key** and **API Secret**. We will be needing the Cloud name on the client to request for images


> The contents (images and videos) I will be using do not currently exist in your own account. If you need to use them, you can simply inspect the demo source in the browser, download them, and upload to your own server.


## Cloudinary SDKs

You can head to each media file and fetch the URL from the Cloudinary dashboard. This is manual and can sometimes get tedious for automated tasks. Cloudinary has SDKs that assist you in making the process faster. All you just need to know is the media **public Id** and not the full URL.

Select any image on your cloud and you should see both:

Import the SDK libraries to your `public/index.html` right after the div tag:

```html
<div id="app"></div>
<link href="https://unpkg.com/cloudinary-video-player/dist/cld-video-player.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="https://unpkg.com/cloudinary-core/cloudinary-core-shrinkwrap.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/cloudinary-video-player/dist/cld-video-player.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Next, add a `created` lifecycle method in the `App` object that initializes Cloudinary with your cloud name:

```js
created() {
  this.cloudinaryInstance = window.cloudinary.Cloudinary.new({
    cloud_name: 'YOUR CLOUD NAME',
    secure: true
  });
},
```

## Moive Data Model

Since we do not have any data to show yet and working with defaul values, we can just initialize `movie` as an empty object:

```js
data() {
  return {
    movie: {},
  }
},
```

So far, so good:

# Media Delivery and Transformation

The hardest content to manage on the Web is media, not text. Media comprise of almost anything that is not text: images, videos, PDFs, icons, audio, and so forth. You must pay attention to many related issues, such as size, latency, the uploading process, the best way to deliver, and manipulation on the fly.

Cloudinary is an SaaS company that offers solutions for efficiently and effectively uploading, manipulating, and delivering media content to the Web for both mobile and desktop apps.

# What's Next

The purpose of this lab/guides was to give you a hands-on experience on how to build fullstack web apps using modern cutting-edge technologies. Everything you learned today is a de-facto way of building web apps in 2018:

- Component based UI architecture
- Using functions as backend framework to divide and conquer
- Uploading, delivering, streaming and transforming media at the barest minimum cost

This is not where your journey ends. You can reuse the what you learned in any other project or even build on this one to make a streaming service.

## Assignment

You can extend this project to get even more interesting. When you extend, tweet at us @cloudinary so we can share and help you review.

Here are some cool things to try:

1. Try adding a pre or post roll video to each clip (link the line to a recipe)
2. Overlay the logo over the video
3. Use a different poster frame for each video - and stylize them. (r_max or style transfer)

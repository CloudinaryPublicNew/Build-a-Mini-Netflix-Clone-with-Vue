# What's Next

The purpose of this lab is to give you a hands-on experience on how to build full stack web apps using modern cutting-edge technologies. Everything you've learned today is a de-facto way of building web apps in 2018:

* Component based UI architecture
* Using functions as backend framework to divide and conquer
* Uploading, delivering, streaming and transforming media at a bare minimum cost

This is not where your journey ends. You can reuse what you've learned here for future projects or expand on this one to create your own a streaming service!

You can extend this project to get even more interesting. When you extend, tweet at us [@cloudinary](https://twitter.com/cloudinary) so we can share and help you review.

Here are some cool things to try:

1. Try adding a pre or post roll video to each clip
2. [Overlay](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations#image_and_text_overlays) the logo over the video
3. Use a different poster frame for each video - and stylize them. \([r\_max](https://cloudinary.com/cookbook/applying_rounded_corners_to_an_image) or [style transfer](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/neural_artwork_style_transfer_addon)\)

# What's Next

The purpose of this lab/guides was to give you a hands-on experience on how to build fullstack web apps using modern cutting-edge technologies. Everything you learned today is a de-facto way of building web apps in 2018:

- Component based UI architecture
- Using functions as backend framework to divide and conquer
- Uploading, delivering, streaming and transforming media at the barest minimum cost

This is not where your journey ends. You can reuse the what you learned in any other project or even build on this one to make a streaming service.

# Setup of a Webtask Server

Now letâ€™s set up a back-end server for hosting and provisioning the data for the Vue app (the clone).

[Webtask](https://webtask.io/) by [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is a Function as a Service (FaaS) platform that gives you the super powers to provision a hosted function as an endpoint. Basically, you install a CLI command and use it to deploy functions or a collection of functions


## Install Webtask

You can manage your server functions on the Webtask web console or use the CLI tool. The CLI tool makes more productive because it fits right into your dev experience. Run the following command to install the CLI tool with npm:

```bash
npm install -g wt-cli
```

To actually deploy functions you need to have a Webtask account. You can do that by simply running the following command:

```bash
wt init <YOUR-EMAIL>
```

## Test Drive Webtask

Just before we get into the real server thing, it would be cool to see how Webtask works. Create a new folder named `demo-server` and add an `index.js` file with the following content:

```js
module.exports = function (cb) {
    cb(null, 'Hello World');
}
```

Once we run this function with Webtask, the content passed as the the second argument to `cb` will be displayed in the browser. Run with this:

```bash
wt create index
```

Take the URL printed in the terminal and open in the browser. You should see the following:

## Server Dependencies

One other thing that makes Webtask cool is that it allows you to have a `package.json` file with possible dependencies. Create one and add the following to it:

```json
{
    "name": "server",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "main": "index.js",
    "license": "MIT",
    "dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^1.18.2",
    "express": "^4.16.3",
    "mongoose": "^5.0.10",
    "webtask-tools": "^3.2.0"
    }
}
```

We have few dependencies here:


- We need **express** for routing just like a regular web server.
- **mongoose** is an ORM for working with a Mongo database we will create soon.
- **body-parser** parses the HTTP body coming in from a client.
- The [programming model](https://webtask.io/docs/model) for Webtask is to use functions as endpoints. webtask-tools  is a library that allows you to alter the model. Hence, you can have express routes rather than having functions.

Replace the `index.js` with the following:

```js
var Express = require('express');
var Webtask = require('webtask-tools');
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
var app = Express();
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hellow World');
})

module.exports = Webtask.fromExpress(app);
```

This also prints the same thing as the first example but this time you can have more routes.

# Media Delivery and Transformation

The hardest content to manage on the web is not text, it’s media. Media comprises of almost anything that is not text on the web— images, videos, PDFs, icons, audio, etc. You need to worry about things like size, latency, how to upload, best way to deliver, manipulating on the fly, etc. If you ever built a media-heavy website or attempted to, you might be able to relate.

Problems like this have been considered and collectively solved by Cloudinary. Cloudinary is a SaaS company that provides features for uploading, manipulating and effectively delivering media content to web, mobile and desktop apps.

Cloudinary also provides a fully-featured HTML5-based video player. This player makes it easy to embed videos to your site and deliver these videos effectively.

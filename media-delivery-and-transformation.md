# Media Delivery and Transformation

The toughest content to manage on the Web is media, not text. Media comprise of almost anything that is not text: images, videos, PDFs, icons, audio, and so forth. You must pay attention to many related issues, such as size, latency, the upload process, the best delivery method, and manipulation on the fly.
